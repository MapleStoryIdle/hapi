# Contributing to SHAPI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SHAPI! We welcome bug fixes, feature suggestions, and thoughtful contributions from the community.

## Code of Conduct

- **Be friendly and respectful** - Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism
- **Help others** - Share knowledge and assist fellow contributors
- **Give constructive feedback** - Focus on the code, not the person
- **Be patient** - Remember that everyone has different experience levels

## AI-Generated Code Policy (Vibe Coding)

If you used AI tools to generate code ("Vibe Coding"), please disclose the model in your PR description. Code is judged on merit — focused scope, tests, and the other expectations below apply equally regardless of how the code was authored.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### No Mega PRs

We do not accept oversized pull requests that introduce large features all at once. Large PRs are:

- Difficult to review thoroughly
- More likely to introduce bugs
- Harder to revert if issues arise

**If you want to add a significant feature, please open an issue first to discuss the approach.** We can help break it down into smaller, reviewable chunks.

### PR Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused on a single concern
- Write clear commit messages
- Include relevant tests if applicable
- Update documentation if needed
- Reference related issues in your PR description

### Security and Privacy Check

Before pushing, confirm that the change contains no credentials, private keys,
pairing codes, session transcripts, personal data, or production logs. If
Gitleaks is installed, scan the staged change locally:

```bash
gitleaks protect --staged --redact
```

CI also scans the checked-out repository. Do not paste an unredacted scanner
finding into a public issue or pull request; rotate any exposed credential and
use [private vulnerability reporting](SECURITY.md) when disclosure is needed.

## Bug Reports

Bug reports are always welcome! When reporting a bug, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Node/Bun version, etc.)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
